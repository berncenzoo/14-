          Palangga ko, happy monthsary baby!  <br />Today serves as yet another reminder of how lucky I am to have you in my life, and every moment we've spent together feels like a gift from God. You have filled my life with more joy, love, and light than I could have ever imagined. I appreciate you staying with me, choosing me each and every day, and loving me even when I forget to love myself. I can't wait to make more memories with you, explore new places, eat more food, and pursue more dreams with you because you are more than I could have ever asked for. No matter what happens, know that my heart is always yours. I love you so much, and I always will. Hereâ€™s to us, to this beautiful journey, and to many not more months but a whole lifetime of loving each other. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BABY!
